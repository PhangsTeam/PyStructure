PyStructure Documentation
==========================

PyStructure is an astronomical analysis software script build on Python. It's intended for the analysis of a set of 3D and 2D astrophysical data. The script will homogenize the data sets and produce a science-ready table that makes it possible to compare the various observations sightline-by-sightline.
